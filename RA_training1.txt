- Avoid yes/no , closed-answer questions


- Asking questions can derail convos
 --- always ask how they are feeling and their experience
 --- holding silences can people time to think

- Keep an open-mind and don't label
 --- avoid projecting
 --- avoid giving advice (you should do xyz)
 --- are they asking for your personal opinion or validating their experience

- Subvocalizaiton: non-vocal cues suggesting agreement or engaging in the convo


- practice containment to gently redirect off-topic convo to initial points, and direct caller to relevant resources
